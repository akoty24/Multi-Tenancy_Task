# Multi-Tenancy Laravel Backend Development

## Overview

This project implements a Laravel backend with Multi-Tenancy support, allowing multiple users (tenants) to use the application with their own isolated data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your database settings.

4. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

## Multi-Tenancy Configuration

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Each tenant has its own database.
   - Database connections are dynamically configured based on the current tenant.

2. **Tenant Identification**:
   - Tenants are identified based on subdomains.

## Security

- Authentication and authorization are implemented using Laravel Passport/Sanctum.
- Ensure to secure sensitive data and endpoints from unauthorized access.

## Scalability

- The application is designed to scale horizontally to handle increased loads.
- Use load balancers and caching mechanisms to distribute traffic and improve performance.

## Error Handling

- Robust error handling and logging mechanisms are implemented to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.

## Usage

1. Register a new tenant.
2. Access the application using the registered subdomain.
3. Use appropriate authentication credentials to access tenant-specific resources.
